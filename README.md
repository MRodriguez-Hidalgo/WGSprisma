# WGSprisma

As the implementation of whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasing, it is desired to standardize and unify data analysis pipelines. We have developed an application, coined WGSPrisma, for automated variant filtering and prioritization in inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD).

WGSprisma provides an efficient strategy for WGS-data variant filtering and prioritization, which aids in determining genetic diagnosis in unsolved cases.

The code is not currently publicly available.
